        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Marco, and I specialize in the art of programming and system administration.
           I've always wanted to work in this field, and when I had the opportunity, I began studying the intermediate technical course in 'Microcomputer Systems and Networks.' I plan to pursue the higher technical course in 'Multimedia Application Development' and then a university degree. I am a person with clear goals, and I am fluent in English as a second language.

        <h3>3DSOULSCHOOL - SUPERIOR SCHOOL IN DIGITAL ARTS</h3>
        <p>
          Here I got my first real professional experiences, I had to create a 3D visor for the school's website, where all the 3D models created could be uploaded and viewed online, with a huge variety of options and configurations

        <h3>3DSOULSCHOOL - SUPERIOR SCHOOL IN DIGITAL ARTS</h3>
        <p>
          This project took me a couple weeks, where I created a really customizable 3D visor, with node.js backend support, to upload and update the models.

            <h3>What is the MERN stack?</h3>
            <p>
              The MERN stack is a set of technologies I used to build this full-stack web application using JavaScript: <br><br>

              <strong>MongoDB</strong> ‚Äì NoSQL database for storing data.<br>

              <strong>Express.js</strong> ‚Äì Web framework for Node.js to handle backend logic and APIs.<br>

              <strong>React</strong> ‚Äì Frontend library for building user interfaces.<br>

              <strong>Node.js</strong> ‚Äì JavaScript runtime to run backend code.<br><br>

              Together, they enable developers to use JavaScript for both client and server sides.
