        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Marco, and I specialize in the art of programming and system administration.
           I've always wanted to work in this field, and when I had the opportunity, I began studying the intermediate technical course in 'Microcomputer Systems and Networks.' I plan to pursue the higher technical course in 'Multimedia Application Development' and then a university degree. I am a person with clear goals, and I am fluent in English as a second language.

        <h2>üíª Professional History</h2>

        <h3>3DSOULSCHOOL - SUPERIOR SCHOOL IN DIGITAL ARTS</h3>
        <p>
          Here I got my first real professional experiences, I had to create a 3D visor for the school's website, where all the 3D models created could be uploaded and viewed online, with a huge variety of options and configurations

        <h3>3DSOULSCHOOL - SUPERIOR SCHOOL IN DIGITAL ARTS</h3>
        <p>
          This project took me a couple weeks, where I created a really customizable 3D visor, with node.js backend support, to upload and update the models.
